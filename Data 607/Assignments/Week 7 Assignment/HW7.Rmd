## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(XML)
library(jsonlite)
library(methods)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)
library(DT)
```

```{r html}
html_file = GET("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mianshariq/SPS/main/Data%20607/Assignments/Week%207%20Assignment/booklist.html", ,config(sslversion=6,ssl_verifypeer=1))

 booksHTML <- htmlParse(file = "booklist.html")
 booksHTML <- readHTMLTable(booksHTML, stringAsFactors=FALSE)
 booksHTML <- booksHTML[[1]]
 datatable(booksHTML)
```

```{r xml}
xml_file <- GET("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mianshariq/SPS/main/Data%20607/Assignments/Week%207%20Assignment/booklists.xml", config(sslversion=6,ssl_verifypeer=1))
xml_file

```

```{r json}
json_file <- GET("https://github.com/mianshariq/SPS/raw/df58e815f1ddf9f2b951d3e60c82106262828a14/Data%20607/Assignments/Week%207%20Assignment/booklist.json")
```

```{r}

```


```{r}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
